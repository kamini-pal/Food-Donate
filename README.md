# Food waste management system
<h1>Objective:</h1>
<p>
The Food Donation Platform aims to reduce food wastage and address hunger by connecting food donors with NGOs and charities. It facilitates the donation, management, and distribution of excess or leftover food using an organized and efficient system. The platform ensures that surplus food reaches those who need it most, minimizing waste while helping the community.</p>




<h1>Detailed Overview of Modules:</h1>
<h3>1. User Module</h3>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
This module is designed for donors, including individuals, restaurants, marriage halls, or other organizations, who wish to contribute excess food for social good.

<h2>Key Features:</h2>

<h3>User Registration and Login:</h3>

Users can create an account to access the platform.
Secure login system using authentication ensures data safety.
Food Donation Form:

Users specify the type of food (e.g., cooked, raw, vegetarian, non-vegetarian) and its quantity.
They provide details like pickup location, expiration time, and any special handling instructions.
Donation History:

Users can track their contributions, view previous donations, and monitor the status of ongoing ones.
How It Works:

A restaurant has leftover food after a day’s operations.
They log in, fill out the donation form, and submit details about the food.
This information is shared with the Admin module for matching and processing.
2. Administrator (Admin) Module
Purpose:
This module is for system administrators and registered NGOs/charities. Admins manage and coordinate the food donation process, ensuring that donations reach the right recipients efficiently.

Key Features:

<h3>Donation Management:</h3>

Admins receive food donation details from the User module.
Donations are listed for NGOs and charities to browse and request based on their needs.
NGO/Charity Interaction:

NGOs can view available donations and select food items they require.
Requests for food pickups are sent to the Delivery module.
Tracking and Reporting:

Admins track each donation: who donated, which NGO requested it, and when it was picked up.
Generate detailed reports on food donations and distribution for transparency.
How It Works:

A donation request is submitted by a user.
Admin verifies the donation details and lists it for NGOs to see.
Once an NGO selects a donation, the Admin assigns it to a delivery person for pickup and drop-off.
3. Delivery Person Module
Purpose:
This module is for individuals providing pickup and delivery services for the donated food. They act as a bridge between donors and recipients.

Key Features:

<h3>Delivery Personnel Registration and Login:</h3>

Drivers or volunteers register themselves on the platform to take part in the donation process.
Secure login ensures only verified individuals can participate.
Pickup and Drop-off Management:

Assigned tasks show the pickup location (donor) and drop-off location (NGO/charity).
Includes additional information like contact details, food type, and handling requirements.
Real-Time Status Updates:

Delivery personnel can update the status (e.g., "picked up," "delivered") to keep Admins informed.
How It Works:

A delivery person logs in and sees a list of assigned tasks.
They pick up the food from the donor’s location and deliver it to the NGO, updating the system throughout the process.
Technologies Used:
Frontend:

HTML: For creating the structure of the web pages.
CSS: For styling and designing a responsive interface.
JavaScript: For interactive features like form validation, dynamic updates, and user experience enhancements.
Backend:

PHP: Handles server-side logic, including form submissions, authentication, and data processing.
Database:

MySQL: Stores user information, donation records, NGO requests, and delivery statuses securely.
Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented:
Challenge: Ensuring secure and accurate data handling across all modules.

Solution: Used validation mechanisms for input fields and implemented authentication protocols.
Challenge: Matching donations with appropriate NGOs/charities.

Solution: Designed a logical workflow where Admins verify and list donations for NGOs to select based on their specific needs.
Challenge: Coordinating delivery operations.

Solution: Developed a clear task assignment and tracking system for delivery personnel to ensure smooth logistics.
